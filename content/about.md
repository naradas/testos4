<p>I have included a sampling of my photography here. You will see images of people, nature, and places. I believe in 
natural photography and always minimize the amount of postproduction work with my photography. </p>

<p>Some visual art historians refer to this philosophy as documentary image capturing, and perhaps that fits, 
as I used to make documentary films. I like to capture moments as they are, where they are, and immortalize 
them as photographs. I see it as capturing time and space forever.</p>

<p>I hope that you enjoy the visual show here, and perhaps decide to commission me to photograph your 
special vent or project.</p>
